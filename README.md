My Megaverse

1. npm i
2. npm start
3. the megaverse is created automatically.
  3.1. But if you want to re-created, you have to press "Create Megaverse"
    3.1.1. That is going to get the goal and from that goal it is going to create your megaverse.
4. It also print on console how many stars are in our goal
5. Then I create every star with a delay of 2 seconds because your api cant resist too many calls at the same time.
6. It print on console every 10 stars to let you know it still working on your megaverse.
7. It print on console "finish" when the megaverse is build.
